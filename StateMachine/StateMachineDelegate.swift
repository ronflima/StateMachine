/// State machine delegate protocol. Gives the opportunity to respond to state transitions
///
/// - Remarks:
/// Methods willTransition and didTransition are called only if the state transition is allowed. If not allowed,
/// for instance, when the graph does not permit it, both are not called. Instead, the failedToTransaction will
/// be called. Since the delegate will receive the origin/destination states as parameters, it can take action 
/// when such a failure arrive.
